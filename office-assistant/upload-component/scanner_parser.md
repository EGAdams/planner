We want to be able to scan images of receipts, parse them somehow, and put them in the same expense database that all of the other data that we have is in.  We want the data to show up in an expense categorizer so that we can easily categorize data from receipts that an AI vision model could view.  or maybe we could use gpt-5-nano to look at the receipts.  or Google nano something... 

I need you to put this a request in writing to an Expert Planner that will make all of the plans and all of the code for us.  Knowing what you know about the system, you should be in a better position than me to write this request.  Tell the expert about our directory structure near the place around the code where the PDFs get uploaded.  So I need your help to request what we need to accomplish to have this happen.  Once we get the plans back from the Expert, we'll add the ScannerParser to our system.

For example, you will start with this:

```
Hello, we need your expertise in helping us build a new component for our system.  We want to be able to scan receipts, and parse them somehow.

We also need your help in finding an AI solution to parsing receipts.  I don't even know if I need an AI for that or not so I need to know what my options are there.

Please give us complete instructions and source code in ONE markdown document.  Our staff of engineers will digest the document that you write and write all of the directories and/or files that we need to get the new system to work.

...
...
```

Add any details like what type of database that we are using, our directory structure, or anything else that the Expert Planner will need for him to write us the plan.  We need him to write ALL of our source code too, so put that in the final request.
