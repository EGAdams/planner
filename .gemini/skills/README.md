# Agent Skills

This directory stores reusable skills that are dynamically created by agents.

## Overview

In line with the principles of building more efficient AI agents, this directory serves as a persistent library of capabilities. Instead of being limited to a predefined set of tools, agents can write, save, and share their own scripts here.

- **Persistence:** Skills saved here are available across different tasks and sessions.
- **Reusability:** Agents can execute these scripts to perform common tasks without having to recreate the logic each time.
- **Evolution:** As agents solve new problems, this library of skills will grow, making the entire system more capable over time.

## Format

Skills are typically shell scripts (`.sh`) or other executable files that can be run in the environment. They should be named descriptively to allow agents to discover and understand their purpose.
