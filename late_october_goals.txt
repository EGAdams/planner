 /van @pickle_digi.cpp When the pickle digi C++ process is run, the two Zeros in the top middle section should be on during pairing and blink.  Once each team is paired, the respective little Red or Green "0" should stop blinking and stay on steady once the Team is paired.  Right now, the Little "0" in the top middle of the PickleDigiScoreBoard is representing the number of serves remaining for the team.  This is not right, the Yellow numbers at the top left and the top right should reflect the number of serves left for the rescpective Team.  The little "0"s in the top represent the Teams score of 0 only and should go off when the Team receives their first point.  In the beginning of a Doubles game for example, the Team that starts gets 2 serves and the big "2" should be showing on the topmost left or topmost right of the scoreboard depending on which team is serving.  When that Team looses a point, the big number goes to "1".  When that Team looses another point in a Doubles game, the big Yellow number should go completely off and the other Team should then show "2" to give the opposite Team 2 serves to start with.

/van @.claude-collective/agents.md @.claude/agents @agent-testing-implementation-agent The agent-tesing-implementation-agent needs its llm changed.  It is using Calude as an llm now, but instead we want it to use a gpt-5-codex powered Agent.  Please alter the Testing Implementation expert to use a Codex Agent through the communication interfaces that are allready built.  Here is the directory for those tools: @communicaton_interface/

Then see how he used the claude agent sdk and let's make a collaboration.

*** blue time ***
how can we use the new claude web to be more productive?

*** blue time ***
dig up some memory solutions.  what happend to lance and mem0?  what about the letto solution?

*** blue time ***
Archon code review and possible switchover to lance or chroma.

/van Let's create a memory agent using the codex sdk.  All agents should be able to send "memories" to this agent that we create.  The new memory agent should be able to answer quesions about the past using it's memory.  Read the LETTA_INTEGRATION.md document for a guide to implementing the new memory agent's memory.

Check out the project here: /home/adamsl/claude-code-sub-agent-collective  This is where all of the source code for the Claude Agent Collective is.  It works very well with the Claude Code ecosystem.  We are trying to use the gpt-5-codex cli from OpenAI instead of using Claude from Anthropic.  After you take a look at that project, everything should become clear to you as to what we are trying to accomplish and what is wrong with us(our system).

Good morning, Roy

My day off was non-stop work until about 3am.  I got some sleep.

I will be working on those tweaks now.  

EG


I am trying to fill out a bill pay form at my American Momemtum Bank.  I have already given them the account number of the bank.
The payment is going to Bank of America.  It is asking for the Payee ZIP Code.  What should I use for Bank of America Florida?

Good morning, Roy

I'm glad that everything went good.  Thank you for the update.

You have a great day and I will see you in the morning.
