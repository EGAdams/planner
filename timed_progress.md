# Timed Progress Log

### Sep 28, 7:14 AM EDT - Initial Status Assessment
‚óè Looking at the git status, here's what I can tell about current work:

**Active Work Areas:**
1. PLAN.md - Modified (likely tracking current project status/next steps)
2. nonprofit_finance_db/ - This appears to be the main active project with several components:
   - models/__init__.py - Modified (database model changes)
   - scripts/demo.py - Modified (demo/testing updates)

**New Development (Untracked Files):**
- Receipt Processing: meijer_first_grocery.jpeg, meijer_grocery_receipt.csv - suggests working on receipt/transaction parsing
- Core Infrastructure: New modules for detection/, ingestion/, parsers/ - building out financial data processing pipeline
- Database Integration: db_integration_instructions.md - documenting database setup
- Testing: tests/ directory and pytest.ini - setting up test framework

**Current Focus:** You're building a nonprofit finance database system that can:
- Parse financial documents (PDFs, receipts)
- Ingest transaction data
- Detect patterns in financial data
- Integrate with MySQL database

The modified files suggest you're currently working on the data models and demo functionality, while the untracked files show you're actively developing the core parsing and ingestion pipeline.
